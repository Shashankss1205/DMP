Rose came home from school with a new idea.
“Appa! I know how to make compost!”




“What is compost?” asked Appa, scratching his head.
“Can I make it in the backyard, Appa?” Rose asked, tugging Rocky’s ear.
“But what is compost?” Appa asked, scratching his ear.



			


“It’s what plants eat, Appa,” said Rose. It makes them grow tall and strong.”
“
Baaaaa!
 Even I knew that!” bleated Rocky.
Appa looked worried.
“
Oh, don't worry, Appa. All I need to make compost is waste
.”


		

			
Off they ran to the backyard to dig a hole. 
“Do you know what we need for compost, Rocky?”



		

			


“We need lots of vegetable and fruit peels.
 
See, we don't have to waste anything any more!"

		
 
“We need lots 
of newspapers!”
 
“We need dry leaves!”
 
“And we 
need water!”


 
“Where did 
everything go?”
 
                                                 
                                             
                                                           
“ROCKY!”
