I am
an architect.

Architects
design and make buildings because 
they like buildings and houses. Just
like I do.

Which
is why Ma calls me her 'little architect'.


To build a house, you need space in some place.
Your
house could be in a full-of-trees forest place,
a hot-hot-hot desert
place,
a really-high-up mountain place,



a brrr-it’s-full-of-snow place,
a splashy-sploshy rainy place,
a muddy green village place
or a tall-and-big-can’t-see-the-end city place.
Or be a house inside a house!
To
build a house, you also need stuff. To find stuff, you must look
around.

A
forest has trees. A mountain has stones. The Arctic has snow. A
village has mud, big leaves for thatch, and bamboo. A city has
bricks, cement, steel and glass.


A house has all kinds of stuff.



	
	
	
	


Before
you build your house, you must know what you want it to do.
 





	
	
	
	


Igloos
made of snow keep you warm!

Wood
and stone houses with sloping roofs make the rain and snow run right
off. 

Native
American teepees made with poles and animal hide keep you cosy. They
are easy to pack up and carry around. 

Houses
on stilts keep you away from water…
 




… and wild animals!





	
	
	
	


Once
you have space and stuff, you begin to build.
 


Your
house can be any shape and size.
  

Round
and small like a mud house with a thatched roof. 
Tall-enough-to-scrape-the-sky skyscraper. 

Upside-down-ice-cream-cone 
teepee
.
Round-like-a-cake Mongolian 
yurt
.
Ball-sliced-in-half 
igloo
.
Huge-castle-shaped … 



To know more about the houses marked out in bold lettering, turn to the back section.


... castle!


Or a super-fancy house like mine.



	
	
	
	


But
the best house of all…
 


…
has family to make it a home!





	
	
	
	



Some Houses Around the World
Yurt: 
Found in Mongolia, yurts are made with a wood frame and thick mats. The parts of the yurt are light enough to be carried on horses and
yaks.




Teepee: 
Made with long poles and animal hide by the Native North American
Tribes in the plains, this is another house that can be packed up
and carried around!


Toda dogle:
 A half-barrel-shaped hut of the Toda tribe, these
are made with sticks, bamboo and thatch. They have a tiny entrance to
crawl through. This keeps out wild animals. The Toda people live in
the Nilgiri hills in South India.




Igloo:

Did you know that a house made of tightly-packed snow bricks can keep
you warm? At least warmer than the-40 degrees centigrade outside!
You can find them in the Canadian Arctic and in Thule in Greenland.
Stilts:
 What shape is that? Like an insect? Stilts help keep the place cool and are common in South East Asia.
