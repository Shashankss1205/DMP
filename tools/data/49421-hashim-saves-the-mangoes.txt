Hashim loves mangoes.
This summer, the mangoes are about to spoil. 
Hashim wants to save them.
Baba tells Hashim that if he removes water from 
the mangoes, they will not spoil.
“Germs cannot live 
without water,” he says.
“How do we take water out of the mangoes?” asks Hashim.
“Add salt to them!” says Baba.
Then Baba and Hashim keep the mangoes out in the sun to dry.
They put the mangoes in a bottle with some oil.
Oil doesn’t let germs from the air reach the mangoes.
“Baba, we have made pickle!” says Hashim.
 


How can we preserve our favourite 
fruits and vegetables?


Potato slice + boil + dry = potato chips 
(to be fried and eaten)
Any fruit + sugar + lemon + cook = jam
Tomato + salt + sun + oil = sun-dried tomatoes
Lemon + salt = lemon preserves
