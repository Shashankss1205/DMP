Neema thought a lot about her birthday. She asked her friends, “Is your birth date the same as mine? My mother told me I was born on February 29th.” None of her friends shared her birth date.
Neema asked her mother, “Ma! Last year we didn't celebrate my birthday. How is it that my friend Anna celebrates her birthday every year?”
Her mother said, “Be patient, Neema. Your birthday will come and when it does, we’ll throw a big party for you. We’ll invite all your friends.”
Neema said, “But Ma, I waited for it last year. The year ended without my birthday ever arriving.”
“For Anna’s birthday, we gave her so many presents and congratulated her. We ate and sang beautiful songs. We were all so happy. I also want to invite all my friends so that we can eat, play together and sing.”
“Don’t worry, Neema,” said her mother. "Your birthday is next week, isn't it? We’ll throw a big birthday party.” But Neema didn't believe her. What if her birthday never came, like last year? 
The next week, it was 29th February! Neema was thrilled. 
Her birthday had come after all! “It’s my birthday!” she shouted.
Neema’s friends had come. They had all brought her presents. Her parents also gave her a present: a colourful birthday hat. She looked lovely!
Neema looked at the presents. There were so many! Her mother told her, “Neema, your birthday is celebrated on a leap year, which happens only once in four years.”
“Thank you, Papa. Thank you, Ma. Goodbye, 29th February. We’ll meet again after four years!”
