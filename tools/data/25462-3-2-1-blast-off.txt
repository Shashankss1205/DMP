12 dreamy ​constellations
​floating in space























A CONSTELLATION is a group of stars that forms a pattern in the sky. 
It
sometimes looks like a mythological character or an animal 
if you have a good
imagination.






Cygnus, Lacerta, Triangulum, Cepheus, the Little Dipper, Lynx, Draco, Hercules, the Big Dipper, Scutum and Orion are names of 


the 
constellations on page 2.


















11 shiny ​satellites up in the
sky
 


A SATELLITE is an object that goes around a planet or a star. 
Earth has a natural satellite -- the moon. Artificial satellites are launched into space for communications, astronomy, 
and weather studies.

 
10 busy ​engineers ​working on a
rocket


Mechanical ENGINEERS, electrical ENGINEERS, 
and electronics ENGINEERS
work together 
to assemble a rocket.






















9 expert scientists calculating
the ​orbit


SCIENTISTS figure out what path the satellite will take when it is in
space. 
The path was called orbit.






















8 stable ​planets ​going around
the sun





Four rocky inner PLANETS -- Mercury, 
Venus, Earth, 
Mars -- and 
four gassy outer PLANETS -- Jupiter, 
Saturn, 
Uranus, 
Neptune -- 
make up the 
eight major PLANETS
 of our solar system. 
Pluto used 
to be the ninth planet but in 2006,
International Astronomical 
Union (IAU) 
decided that Pluto was a dwarf planet.


















7 icy ​comets ​passing through





 
COMETS are large chunks of ice, rock and gas.
They orbit the Sun, but
are usually far from Earth.
As they pass, they leave a trail that looks like a
tail.
Some famous comets are Hale-Bopp, Halley,
 Hyakutake and Shoemaker-Levy.


















6 curious people looking through
​telescopes























T
ELESCOPES help us see objects that are far,
far away like the comets,
stars, planets, and moons.






















5 small ​dwarf planets​ hanging
around





DWARF PLANETS are like planets but 
they are much smaller
and they do 
not yet have a clear path around 
the Sun.
This means that objects 
like asteroids and comets litter their 
path. Pluto, Ceres, Eris, Makemake 
and Haumea make up the five
recognized dwarf planets of our 
solar system.
 
4 careful workers ​fueling the
rocket


 
Just like cars need petrol to run,
rockets need FUEL to take off and do their job. 
Rockets can use both liquid fuel and solid fuel.


3 skilled 
astronauts 
in their 
spacesuits
SPACESUITS protect astronauts in space. 
Suits have 
oxygen supplies for astronauts to breathe, 
and also 
water to drink. 
They prevent astronauts from getting too
hot or too cold, and keep them safe from space dust.
2 eager kids at the mission 
control centre...
MISSION CONTROL CENTRE is a room where team leaders 
get together 
and make sure the launch goes smoothly and
everything works as 
designed till the mission is complete.


















1 roaring ​rocket ​ready to
soar!


A ROCKET is a self-propelled vehicle that can shoot into space. 
It is
used to launch man-made satellites into space.




 
Blast-off!
 
India created a world record in 2017 when it launched 104
satellites from a single rocket, PSLV-C37. 
Scientists at the Indian 
Space Research Organisation (ISRO) 
launched the rocket from
the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh.
