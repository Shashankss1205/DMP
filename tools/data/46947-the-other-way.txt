Tall
 like a tree
Short
 like grass




Up
 in the sky is a cloud
Down
 in the soil is an earthworm


Light
 like a petal
 
Heavy
 like a rock


Over
 the leaf is a caterpillar
Under
 the leaf is a dragonfly




Quick 
as a squirrel
Slow 
as a snail




Birds 
before
 sunrise
Bats 
after
 sunset


Above
 the tree is 
the moon
Below 
the tree is you!
