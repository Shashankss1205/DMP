One day, a little mouse climbed onto the table to explore. "Oooh, yum! This looks tasty."
"Oww! Owww! Who’s hurting me?" cried a voice. 
"Who are you?" asked the mouse.
"I’m a mouse," was the response. 
"But I'm a mouse."
"I’m a mouse too."
The first mouse laughed. 
"Haha! What kind of a mouse are you?
What can you do?"
The mouse ran to the kitchen and brought back some cake. 
"Look! This is what a mouse can do.
A real mouse can eat cake. YOU can't."
"Little mouse, watch and learn," responded the other mouse. 
She pulled up a picture of cake on the computer screen. 
The first mouse was unconvinced. 
"You can’t do what a real mouse can do."
He picked up a pencil from the desk and chewed at it. 
"Look at what I did to this pencil - this is what a real mouse can do!"
The other mouse pulled up a picture of some logs onto the screen. 
"I can do more than that. Look!"
"Well, can you dance like me?" asked the first mouse. 
Suddenly, the house cat appeared, hissing. 
"OH NO!
Help!" cried the first mouse. 
"What do I do? What do I do?" the first mouse cried, running away. 
The other mouse acted quickly, bringing up a video of a barking dog on the screen to scare the cat away. 
"BOW! BOW! BOW!"

			


The first mouse gave the other mouse a hug. 

"Thank you! You saved my life. You’re a good mouse, just like me."
