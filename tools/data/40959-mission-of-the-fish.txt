Tengra and Puti are playing in the river. All of a sudden, Tengra bumps his head on something hard.
"Ouch! What is that?” Tengra says angrily. 
It is a coconut shell. 
“Have rivers become dumping grounds for trash?" Puti asks.
The river used to be so beautiful! 
Tengra thinks.
He swims around and notices more garbage. 
 The water is dirty and full of people's trash. 
Tengra becomes more and more angry. 
Tengra gathers his friends Puti, Rui, Katla, Chingri and Koi and asks for their help. How can they make the place where they live cleaner? The fish decide to speak directly with the humans.
The next day, Tengra and his friends visit the river bank and spot a boy throwing trash into the water. They tell him gently, “You are polluting our home. Why are you throwing your garbage into the river?"
 The boy is surprised. “I’m so sorry,” he says in a small voice. “I never thought about what I was doing.” 
The boy begins spreading the message of the fish to all his friends. Everyone listens.
All the fish dance with joy.
The next day, Tengra and his friends swim excitedly to school. They know that their home will become beautiful again.
